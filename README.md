# LOGKEEPER APP

## To run the entire app

- Run the frontend (this repo)
- Run the backend database.js file in node and download sql file with required database

## Completed features

- Working long wood measuring calculator
- Every single 
- the calculator lets you choose the project and the woodpile from selected project 
- Simple backend to send the data to (Node/Express and MySql database)

## To do (many things but here are some of them)

- Rebuild database in more sensible way – too many repeating values in separate tables
- Use redux to store state - too many useState() calls (the code becomes messy in early stage)
- Coordinates uploaded automatically by device location
- Other measurement method – stack
- Add woodpile list
- Add truck/delivery list
- Field with different wood types
- Google maps with pins that show where wood is stored
- Measurements to excel or pdf file
- Report page with different kinds of reports
